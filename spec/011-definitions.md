A server organizes activities between one or more clients. The server
waits for clients to request an activity, that the server may or may
not organize. Activities cannot be changed, after they have been
requested.

The server and the client communicate using a text-based,
line-oriented protocol, over a reliable, ordered and error-checked
transport layer (e.g. TCP).
