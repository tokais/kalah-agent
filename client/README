This is the template for a KGP agent using Python.  It contains the
following files to get started:

* agent.py

  We suggest you implement your agent in this file.  It imports the
  library that you don't have to touch.  The file already includes a
  few hints and ideas that will help you along.

* kgp.py

  This file implements the networking managment (TCP and Websocket)
  and the protocol parsing.

* ABOUT

  The file describing your submission.  We require your team to be
  able and provide at least a basic description of their approach.
  This file also contains a list of all your team members. DO NOT
  FORGET to fill it out before submitting your solution.

* Dockerfile

  The actual tournament makes use of Docker containers[0], and we want
  all submissions to be uploaded with a functional "Dockerfile" (that
  describes how the agent is built and executed).

  In case you decide to want to use non-standard libraries or FFIs,
  please make sure to adjust and test the Dockerfile, to make sure it
  will build on our end.  A good starting point is often to start with
  the Alpine[1] or Debian containers[2], install all the necessary
  dependencies and then progress to building your image.

* practice.sh

  Use this script to have "agent.py" connect to the public practice
  server (https://kalah.kwarc.info).  This is just a convenience
  feature, you don't have to use it.

* prepare.sh

  Use this script to bundle your agent and all related files into a
  complete submission.  The script will try and to some basic checks
  to make sure all the necessary conditions for a submission are met.
  Not all submissions that pass this script are necessarily correct,
  but if the script emits an error or a warning, there is probably
  something wrong.

If you have any issues, please refer to the information on the public
practice server:

README2

This is a client-side library implementation of the Kalah Game Protocol
(KGP), written in Python 3[0].  It implements the base protocol, without
any extensions.  Currently, it assumes the "freeplay" mode.

This core functionality depends only on core Python 3 packages, and
thus requires no external dependencies.  To use, just make sure that
kgp.py is in PYTHONPATH, and import the "kgp" module.

If you need to use websocket, you will have to install the
websocket-client[1] library.  You should be able to install this using
your local system package manager[2].

Client examples can be found in the examples/ subdirectory.

Pykgp should be compatible with PyPy[3], an alternative and faster
implementation of Python.
