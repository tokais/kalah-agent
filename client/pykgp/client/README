This is the template for a KGP agent using Python.  It contains the
following files to get started:

* agent.py

  We suggest you implement your agent in this file.  It imports the
  library that you don't have to touch.  The file already includes a
  few hints and ideas that will help you along.

* kgp.py

  This file implements the networking managment (TCP and Websocket)
  and the protocol parsing.

* ABOUT

  The file describing your submission.  We require your team to be
  able and provide at least a basic description of their approach.
  This file also contains a list of all your team members. DO NOT
  FORGET to fill it out before submitting your solution.

* Dockerfile

  The actual tournament makes use of Docker containers[0], and we want
  all submissions to be uploaded with a functional "Dockerfile" (that
  describes how the agent is built and executed).

  In case you decide to want to use non-standard libraries or FFIs,
  please make sure to adjust and test the Dockerfile, to make sure it
  will build on our end.  A good starting point is often to start with
  the Alpine[1] or Debian containers[2], install all the necessary
  dependencies and then progress to building your image.

* practice.sh

  Use this script to have "agent.py" connect to the public practice
  server (https://kalah.kwarc.info).  This is just a convenience
  feature, you don't have to use it.

* prepare.sh

  Use this script to bundle your agent and all related files into a
  complete submission.  The script will try and to some basic checks
  to make sure all the necessary conditions for a submission are met.
  Not all submissions that pass this script are necessarily correct,
  but if the script emits an error or a warning, there is probably
  something wrong.

If you have any issues, please refer to the information on the public
practice server:
