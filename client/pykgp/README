This is a client-side library implementation of the Kalah Game Protocol
(KGP), written in Python 3[0].  It implements the base protocol, without
any extensions.  Currently, it assumes the "freeplay" mode.

This core functionality depends only on core Python 3 packages, and
thus requires no external dependencies.  To use, just make sure that
kgp.py is in PYTHONPATH, and import the "kgp" module.

If you need to use websocket, you will have to install the
websocket-client[1] library.  You should be able to install this using
your local system package manager[2].

Client examples can be found in the examples/ subdirectory.

Pykgp should be compatible with PyPy[3], an alternative and faster
implementation of Python.
