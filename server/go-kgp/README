This is a server implementation of the Kalah Game Protocl (KGP),
written in Go[0].  It implements the base protocol, without any
extensions.  Currently, it only supports the "freeplay" and "verify"
mode.

The only build-dependency is the Go toolchain, version 1.16 or newer.
To run the server, type

	$ go run ./cmd/practice

if you wish to start the practice server, or

	$ go run ./cmd/tournament

for the tournament server.

The server can be configured when invoked using a number of flags
(invoke the above command with the "-help" flag for an overview of the
avaliable options) or persistently using a TOML configuration file.
By default go-kgp checks the current working directory for a file
called "server.toml" and tries to load it.  The default configuration
can be dumped

	$ go run ./cmd/practice -dump-config > server.toml

and modified.
